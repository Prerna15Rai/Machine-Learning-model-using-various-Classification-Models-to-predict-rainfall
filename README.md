Project: Rainfall Prediction using Machine Learning

The Daily Buzz, a renowned newspaper in Sydney, aims to enhance its weather prediction column, "The Weather Oracle," by leveraging machine learning expertise. As an ML expert, the task is to develop a classification model using decision trees and ensemble methods to predict rainfall in Sydney. The dataset, spanning 2008-2017, comprises 18 features, including temperature, humidity, and precipitation.

The approach involves:

1. Data preprocessing and cleaning using Python's Pandas library.
2. Decision tree classification using Scikit-learn's DecisionTreeClassifier.
3. Ensemble methods, including Bagging and Boosting, with Random Forest Classifier.
4. Performance evaluation using accuracy scores and confusion matrices.

The best-performing model will be selected, and its performance will be explained. Suggestions for further improvement will be provided.

Deliverables:

- Jupyter Notebook containing:
    - Data preprocessing and visualization.
    - Trained models and performance evaluation.
    - Answers to the 5 questions in markdown format.

Key Python libraries used:

- Pandas for data manipulation.
- Scikit-learn for machine learning algorithms.
- Matplotlib and Seaborn for visualization.

By applying machine learning techniques and Python's robust libraries, this project aims to create an accurate rainfall prediction model for The Daily Buzz, enhancing its weather forecasting capabilities.
